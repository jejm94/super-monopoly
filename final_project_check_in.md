Research Question: Can I use reinforcement learning to create an optimal strategy for playing Super Monopoly?

Modified Rules:
1) n boards with each ‘go’ space acting as a single spot warp from board i to board i + 1 
2) All groups of colors on different boards are distinct (i.e., each color has a subscript per board like red1, red2, …)
3) Utilities now have X5 dice roll multiplier for owning one and X20 dice roll multiplier for owning both
4) Players begin with (normal starting money) + ((n – 1) X 500)
5) Players can now choose to invest in any complete set of properties owned by other players

Ideas to Finish Project:
- The correct environment is important for this project, as the states space is rather complex, so careful effort should be taken with assuring that the environment is correct.
